    <h3>Hometown: Central Valley, California</h3>
    <p>My name is Alyssa Dismuke and I am currently enrolled in in the bachelor's degree of Educational Studies. This is my first semester at Mizzou and I am a transfer student from California. 
    I never experineced humidity really until coming here, so this is different. I obtained my associates degree in Business Operations Management in 2020.</p>
