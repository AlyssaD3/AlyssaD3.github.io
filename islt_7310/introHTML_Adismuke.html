    Hello, my name is Alyssa Dismuke. I am a new student at Mizzou as well as a new resident of Missouri. My family and I moved here from central valley California. We have enjoyed our transition (except the summer has been brutal) and like the change of scenery.  People seem friendlier, there is so much green everywhere, and cost of living is affordable! I keep hearing fall is very beautiful and I can't wait to see it.
    I do not have any previous web application or development training experience aside from setting up a Shopify and Etsy store (but not sure if that really counts). I am expecting to have a basic understanding of html. I am hoping this will help me with my career at a local community college in the research department. 
    One of my favorite hobbies is reading. I read more than watch T.V. I can read all day, however, only genres I am interested in. If Iâ€™m not into the book but have to read it for a book club or homework, then it takes me a good while to get through it.
