<p class="intro">I </pclass> love to “tinker” around with creating videos and always on YouTube trying to learn about the basics and also how other video editors stay organized and their certain style. The inspiration that lead to learning more about Canva. I found Canva very easy to use and I felt like I picked up on it very quickly. While I do not consider myself an expert, I feel like I do have a lot of knowledge with creating a wide variety of designs that can be used for a personal and professional lifestyle. </p>
<p>I have used Canva for so many things ranging from personal to business use like:</p>
    <ul>    
    <li>Printable calendars</li>
    <li>Book Logs</li>
    <li>Banner announcements</li>
    <li>Linkable PDF's</li>
    <li>And more!</li>
    </ul> 
</div> 
<div class="workingwithcanva"> 
<p>Working with Canva has unleased so many creative paths for me. I love being able to create within seconds. I plan to learn more about Canva (even becoming Canva Certified) in the near future. I have even started learning Adobe programs, but I personally feel like those are a giant learning curve compared to Canva where I can get started instantly. They offer so many templates to help get you going!</p>
<p>I do plan to continuously use Canva in my personal and professional career because it is so user friendly. Being in the higher education system, there are many advantages to this program and can find many uses for it to help faculty, staff, and students! </p>
