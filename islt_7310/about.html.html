    <h1>Alyssa Dismuke</h1>
    <h3>Hometown: Central Valley, California</h3>
    <p>My name is Alyssa Dismuke and I am currently enrolled in in the bachelor's degree of Educational Studies. This is my first semester at Mizzou and I am a transfer student from California. 
        I never experineced humidity really until coming here, so this is different. I obtained my associates degree in Business Operations Management in 2020. 
        I have a laser machine and I used to be heavily into sublimation but have since let that go. One of my all time favorite things to do is read.
        I can read all day every day and ususally choose it over watching t.v. Good luck everyone!
     </p>   
     <h2>Welcome Everyone!</h2>
     <p>I have selected to do an education website because I feel I have some self-taught knowledge of how to use Canva. I have used Canva faithfully for about three years now. I use it almost every day. There are so many great things that can be made from it. The software is incredibly easy to use as well as create a unique design in moments.</p>
     <h2>My goal for you</h2>
     <p>Even someone with zero graphic skills can design a flyer, resume, brochure, T-shirt quickly and easily. My goal is to break down how to make a design to someone who has never used Canva and show them how their creativity can take them down a new and exciting path. 
        Canva’s free design library is growing, and their features are expanding. Learning about graphic design can be a scary thing to try, but with Canva’s user friendly design software it can help access the creators untapped potential. </p>
