I have selected to do an education website because I feel I have some self-taught knowledge of how to use Canva. I have used Canva faithfully for about three years now. I use it almost every day. There are so many great things that can be made from it. The software is incredibly easy to use as well as create a unique design in moments.
<h2>My goal for you</h2>
Even someone with zero graphic skills can design a flyer, resume, brochure, T-shirt quickly and easily. My goal is to break down how to make a design to someone who has never used Canva and show them how their creativity can take them down a new and exciting path. 
Canva’s free design library is growing, and their features are expanding. Learning about graphic design can be a scary thing to try, but with Canva’s user friendly design software it can help access the creators untapped potential.
